 Ingredients in ingredients.md file go and checkout

so first of all take any 5 biscuits that you choose for make
unwrap and put them all in a bowl 

next we're gonna grind them all in mixie
lets put them all into mixie
switch on the mixie and grind them well into a fine powder

if we set high speed to mixie it'llbe ground to fine powder

after grinding 
we need a packet of milk 
pour it into mixie jar directory

we can pour it into mixie almost 1.5 cups
we can take the level it fits in this jar

 after pouring close the jar and grind it once again
 so the biscuit and milk have been converted into paste
 so we can take the batter into the bow
 
 add1/2 spoon of baking soda
 before mixing 
 add 1 t.spoon of cocoa powder
 if needed a bigger taste mix it well

after mixing batter is ready

in order to bake the cake
we need a pressure cooker
apply oil in order
place the butter paper
like this in the middle

then we can add the cake batter
the batter is very smooth
as we mixed it well for long time
we can add it into cooker

after adding batter we're gonna be start to bake the cake
but we're not gonna keep it directly into stove

we need a dosa tawa or a lid for closing the bowl
place it on stove 
and place the cooker above the lid 
so that the heat will be applied evenly

before switching on the stove 
close the cooker

lit the stove 
put it on full frame for 40 mins

after 40 mins for lit cake is baked so,switch off the stove and open the lid of cooker 

if some cracks are seen in cake there since the cake has risen 
in order to know if the cake is baked well
prick it with a bamboo stick to see the cake is well

after all serve the cake into plate

we placed butter paper in cooker
we can remove it now

after removing cut into 3 layers
we can cut it easily

we can move it aside as well

after moving apply choclate spread or nutella above first layer that we cut it

place it next layer over and apply the spread 
like we did earlier 

place next layer like we did it same

after placing the last layer 
add melted chocolate and apply over it and fill well

after filling add some decorations as your choice like choco chips,bar chocolate or chocolate rolls etc. as your choice
